Simple webpack 4 default project.

- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn build` to compile via webpack
- open `dist/index.html` in a browser and the current Polkadot blocknumber will display

Differences from WP 5 version -

- plugin to support `import.meta.url`
- browserslist for Babel in `package.json`
